\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
\subsection{Runtimes}
Our context extraction and tf-idf computation is 1.30 times faster than the implementation of the Spark MLlib.\\

\subsection{Results}
Precision, Recall, F-Score\\
Wikipedia as ground truth dataset\\
Jan Ehm√ºller evaluates the features more thoroughly in his bachelor thesis~\cite{Jan}.\\
What is precision, recall and fscore and how is it computed (with formulas)?
Comparison of NER and NEL to Alexander Immer's results (regarding precision, recall, fscore)

\subsection{System limitations}
\subsubsection{False positives}
Multiple NEs possible
\subsubsection{False negatives}
