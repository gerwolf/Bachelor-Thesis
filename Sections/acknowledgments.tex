\section*{Acknowledgments}
This project would not have taken place without the help and confidence of some persons that I would like to acknowledge.

First of all, I thank Felix Naumann, who initiated this project, for his interest and helpful advice. He took time to talk with us about our progress and drew attention to the priorities, when necessary.

A very special word of thanks goes to my supervisors, Toni Gr√ºtze and Michael Loster, for their devoted guidance and assistance during the project and in improving this thesis. They were always available when there were open questions.

I would also like to acknowledge our business partners from the Commerzbank AG, Oliver Maspfuhl and Dirk Thomas, for supporting us with the necessary hardware and additional data. They have pointed out why the German Corporate Graph is such a meaningful instrument and its creation an important objective.
