\subsection{CohEEL features}
\label{sec:coheel}

\subsubsection{Link score}
\label{sec:link_score}
Probability that alias is link\\
(Technically just a probability on Wikipedia as a sample)

\subsubsection{Page score}
\label{sec:page_score}
Probability that an alias points to a specific page

\subsubsection{Link context score}
\label{sec:context_score}
Bag of words retrieved form the text around a link (currently +- 20 words)\\
generate tf-idf vectors\\
compute cosine similarity between link vectors and page vectors

\subsection{Tf-idf values}
What are tf-idf values and how is it computed? (with formulas)\\

\subsection{Cosine similarity}
What is cosine similarity and how is it computed? (with formula)\\

\subsection{Second order features}
\subsubsection{Rank}
\subsubsection{Difference to highest value}
$\Delta top$
\subsubsection{Difference to successive value}
$\Delta successor$
